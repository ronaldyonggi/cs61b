    "    * This way, type errors are unlikely to occur on the end user's computer\n",
    "        * E.g. if we're writing an Android app, there should be no danger of type error in people's phones\n",
    "2. Easier to read and reason about code since everything has a type\n",
    "3. Code can run more efficiently\n",
    "    * No need for expensive runtime type checks\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "1. Code is more verbose\n",
    "2. Code is less general\n",
    "    * There is a way around this, called generics\n",
